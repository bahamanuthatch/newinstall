# cpu temperature

The line ${hwmon 0 temp 1} fetches the temperature from your hardware monitor. However, the exact path (0 temp 1) depends on your system.

To find the correct path:
Run sensors again to identify your CPU temperature sensor (e.g., coretemp-isa-0000).

Check the /sys/class/hwmon/ directory:

ls /sys/class/hwmon/

You’ll see folders like hwmon0, hwmon1, etc.

Look for a temp1_input file in one of these folders:

cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input

If it shows a value (e.g., 45000 = 45°C), note the folder number (e.g., hwmon0 = 0).

Update the hwmon 0 temp 1 part in your .conkyrc file to match (e.g., hwmon 1 temp 1 if it’s in hwmon1).
